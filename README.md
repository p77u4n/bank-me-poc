### Method

1. Functional Programming Practice

    * Using pure function
    * Use Functional Domain Modelling:
        * Interface for defining the domain model
        * Methods on it are pure function that receives the domain model instance
        then return the brand new updating instance of it
        * Using Monad structure for modelling exception, async task, and nullable value
    
2. Domain Driven Design + Hexagon Architecture

3. Event Driven Programming

-> For handling the task that includes many consituent tasks that are failable
-> For making some important process extensible by having event listeners listening on the status
of process and doing their own tasks
